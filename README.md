# spotify_stats
A small program to get some stats from Spotify data.

When you request a download of your Spotify data you get a bunch of files that are difficult to make sense of. This programme can give you your top songs or artists, both by amount of plays and amount of minutes listened.

## Notes:
- I assumed the file of data is in the same folder as the code, though you could specify the path of course
- When I requested my data last year I got 2 files, which I manually preprocessed to a single file that only had information on the timeframe I was interested in. The program hence only works with single files and you cannot specify a timeframe in it.
